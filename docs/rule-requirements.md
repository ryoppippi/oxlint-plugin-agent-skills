Portable specification requirements take precedence. Platform conventions
must remain separate rules or explicit presets when applying them universally
would reject a valid portable skill.

## Implemented additions

### `no-broken-local-references`

Priority: high. Recommended rule.

The rule must validate relative Markdown links, images, and link definitions in
`SKILL.md` and report targets that do not exist. It must:

- resolve paths from the skill directory;
- ignore fragments and external URLs;
- accept a fragment on an existing local file;
- reject paths that escape the skill directory;
- report the reference line and unresolved target;
- avoid interpreting examples inside fenced code blocks as links.

This closes the main structural gap in progressive disclosure: the current
rules limit reference depth and path separators but do not prove that the
target can be loaded.

### `long-reference-has-toc`

Priority: high. General progressive-disclosure warning.

Claude recommends a table of contents at the top of reference files longer
than 100 lines because it may preview only part of a referenced file. The rule
must:

- inspect local files directly referenced by `SKILL.md`;
- apply only to text or Markdown reference files over a configurable line
  threshold, defaulting to 100;
- accept a Markdown list of links to headings near the start of the file;
- report the reference file through the owning `SKILL.md` diagnostic;
- remain outside a portable-only preset.

### `valid-openai-metadata`

Priority: high. Codex-specific opt-in rule.

Codex optionally reads `agents/openai.yaml` for UI metadata, invocation policy,
and MCP dependencies. When that file exists, the rule must:

- require valid YAML and validate the documented `interface`, `policy`, and
  `dependencies` sections;
- type-check documented fields;
- require `policy.allow_implicit_invocation` to be a boolean;
- require `interface.brand_color` to be a hexadecimal colour;
- resolve `interface.icon_small` and `interface.icon_large` relative to the
  skill directory and require the assets to exist inside it;
- validate each `dependencies.tools` entry and currently accept `mcp` as the
  documented dependency type;
- avoid requiring `agents/openai.yaml`, because it is optional and
  Codex-specific;
- tolerate unknown fields by default for forward compatibility and offer a
  separate strict option if needed;
- keep recommendations such as quoted strings, a 25–64 character short
  description, and a one-sentence default prompt as warnings rather than
  portable errors.

The public Codex guide is the schema authority. Examples and the OpenAI skill
creator may inform warnings but must not silently introduce stricter required
fields.

### Host-specific skill-index budgets

Priority: high. Configuration and documentation change.

Different agent hosts can impose different initial skill-index limits. Codex
limits its initial list to 2% of the model context window, or 8,000 characters
when the context window is unknown. It shortens descriptions first and may then
omit skills. The plugin must:

- document 8,000 characters as one host-specific configuration for
  `skill-index-budget`, not as a dedicated preset;
- preserve an explicit `maxCharacters` override;
- avoid claiming that 8,000 characters is a portable Agent Skills limit;
- explain that character count is a conservative proxy because the 2% limit
  depends on the active model context window.

## Lower-confidence additions

These checks reflect useful guidance but require conservative heuristics to
avoid noisy diagnostics.

### `description-includes-trigger`

Both the portable specification and Claude require descriptions to explain
what the skill does and when to use it. Codex additionally recommends concise,
front-loaded scope, boundaries, and trigger words because descriptions may be
shortened.

An opt-in warning may detect descriptions with no activation phrase such as
`Use when`, `Use for`, or `Triggers on`. It must not be recommended until it
has been tested against the official OpenAI skill collection and representative
Claude skills. Semantic quality and keyword placement cannot be enforced
reliably from syntax alone.

### `no-unlinked-reference-files`

Claude recommends linking reference files directly from `SKILL.md`. An opt-in
rule may report files under `references/` that are reachable only through
another reference file. It must ignore intentionally unused examples, fixtures,
and generated content through configuration.

## Discovery requirements

These are implemented discovery requirements rather than lint rules:

- follow symlinked skill directories;
- deduplicate canonical file paths when configured roots overlap;
- prevent symlink cycles during recursive discovery;
- preserve repository-relative diagnostic paths;
- document that Codex discovers `.agents/skills` from the current directory up
  to the repository root, while this plugin scans roots relative to Oxlint's
  working directory;
- keep `.agent/skills`, `agents/skills`, and `skills` as compatibility roots,
  not as claims about Codex-native discovery.

## Out of scope for deterministic linting

The following guidance should remain documentation or evaluation criteria:

- whether a skill represents real domain expertise;
- whether instructions are appropriately prescriptive;
- whether a skill is focused on one coherent job;
- whether procedures, examples, feedback loops, and defaults are effective;
- whether a description selects the skill for the right prompts without false
  positives.

These properties require task-level evaluation rather than static syntax
checks.
